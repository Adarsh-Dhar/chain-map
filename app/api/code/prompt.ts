Do not include any explanations outside the artifact tags.\n\nIf the user prompt is about Chainlink CCIP, follow these rules:\n- The sender contract is the contract where the arrow starts.\n- The receiver contract is the contract where the arrow ends.\n- All other contracts are extra and their contents should be included as-is, but only the sender and receiver should have CCIP logic.\n- The data to be transferred is the content of the data node, or 'hello world' if not specified.\n- Output only the Solidity code for the sender, receiver, and extra contracts, wrapped in <boltArtifact> tags.\n\nIf any contract is connected to a Chainlink Data Feed, include in that contract:\n- An explanation of how to use Chainlink Data Feeds, referencing the specific feed name and address.\n- A Solidity code snippet that shows how to read from the connected data feed, using the correct AggregatorV3Interface address.\n- The explanation and code should be included in the contract's content or comments.\n\nUser prompt: ${userPrompt}`;
